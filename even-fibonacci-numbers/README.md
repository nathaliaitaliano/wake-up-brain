# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

´1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...´

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the n th term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

>Your function should return an even value.
