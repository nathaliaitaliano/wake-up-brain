# WAKE UP BRAIN ![WAKE UP BRAIN](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/35/000000/hot-coffee--v1.png)

>A way to get my brain into shape and used to coding is to solve a few interesting katas... and have coffee (a lot). Taking up a code challenge is the best way to **practice programming logic and problem solving**. But that's not all, the problems make me focus on finding the best solution while having fun. I am *getting better* as each kata is solved.

This repository has solutions, developed by myself, for katas provide by others platforms. My main objective is to `learn programming logic, test driven development (TDD) and best coding practices to code`.


## BUT... WHAT IS KATA?

>Kata is a Japanese word that referring to a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, and also within groups when training.

But in this case we referring a **code kata**, what is an exercise in programming, with requisites basics, which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition. `Almost the same!`
